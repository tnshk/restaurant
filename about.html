                    <p>The Palladium Family company was established in 2006 and over its ten-year history has become one of the leaders in the restaurant industry in Kazakhstan. Consumers know and love the establishments of our restaurant chain and primarily appreciate the consistently high quality of food and service.</p>
                    <p>Palladium Family restaurant projects will appeal to representatives of different audiences. So, business people will prefer to hold a business meeting in the Coffeeroom, families will drop in for a Sunday lunch at the Trattoria, beer and live music lovers will become regulars at the Yard House, wine connoisseurs will find real treasures from all over the world in the Wine Cabinet wine cellar, and connoisseurs of oriental cuisines will appreciate pilaf in teahouses "Tubeteika". Masters from Shanghai at the Peking Duck restaurant will introduce you to real imperial Chinese cuisine. Separately, it is worth noting the Palladium restaurant complex, whose banquet hall has long become known and loved among Almaty residents.</p>
                    <p>Palladium Family is a series of successfully implemented projects, on the one hand, and a dynamically developing company that is exploring new directions, on the other. We will delight you with new restaurant projects very soon and will not stop there!</p>
